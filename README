Mail::Graph - visualize mails via graphs (spams, bug reports etc)

I wrote this utility because I wanted to prove that the spam problem is real
and becoing more and more a real problem.

In the directory samples/ is a short example. For a real-life example
please visit <http://bloodgate.com/spams/>.

To install:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test

and then as root:

	make install

Have fun!
