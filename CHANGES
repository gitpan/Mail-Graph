2002-03-29 v0.01 Tels first version
  - derived from stand-alone script
  - graphs: per day
	    per month of year
	    per month
            per day of month
            per year
            per day of week
	    per top-level domain
  - made package, with MANIFEST et al.
  - added some basic pod
  - added two basic tests
  - read in template, and write out as html
  - refined template and made it using a stylesheet
2002-03-31 v0.02 Tels
  - use Date::Calc for Date_to_Days and some others
  - tests for _parse_date
  - _parse_date(): return 0 for undefined or invalid dates, return numerical
    values, correct year to be 4 digits
  - added graph: daily (w/ rolling average) 
		 rule (filter rules)
		 target (per target address)
  - renamed graphs: per_month => monthly, year => yearly
  - added the ability to supress generation of each graph
  - refined sample template
2002-04-07 v0.03 Tels 01:29 (first released version)
  - refined samples to be really generic
  - fixed bug: the last mail per archive was always dropped
  - graph's have now a minimum width to prevent cut-off texts
2002-04-07 v0.04 Tels 05:30
  - /^From/ detection a bit more strict
  - don't die, but warn and skip files that don't look like mail-archives
  - gather_mail: handle non-gziped mail-archives, too
  - gather_files: take all ordinary files (not just *.gz)
  - better doc
2002-04-07 v0.05 Tels 16:43
  - draw values for yearly, and per domain stats
  - draw light-gray y grid
  - fixed width for bars for domain/yearly stats
  - 15% instead 5% on top if values are shown
  - 25% instead 5% on top if values are shown and vertical
  - count items in last 30 days and instert as last_30_days into template
  - fixed pod =hea1 NAME
  - added 'hour' stats
  - can filter out target domains and/or addresses (these appear as unknown)
2002-04-08 v0.06 Tels 00:05 (damn, nearly four releases in one day ;)
  - prediction for current year/month (thanx Bill Kearney)
  - the prediction code made necc. a different algorithmn for determining the
    maximum value, this also fixed the dailys stats, which were too spacy
2002-04-08 v0.07 Tels (never released)
  - fixed CREDITS file
  - fixed history (speling, times)
  - removed some debug prints
2002-04-27 v0.08 Tels
  - added graph: last x days (w/ rolling average for 7 days) 
  - added stats for compressed/uncompressed archive size
  - tests for _average function (testsuite still highly incomplete)
  - option 'average' (for average over Y days) works now
  - removed useless sorting of keys when doing average
  - fixed sample template, and sample script to show new options
  - 38 tests
2002-05-09 v0.09 Tels (never released)
  - refined rule cleaner
  - fixed: input can be a file, too
  - color brown looked ugly, added some more colors to prevent wrap around
2002-08-03 v0.10 Tels
 tests: added some for default and overwritten options, and for month_to_num
	93 tests
 added: param last_date to make stats that end on a different day than today
        param average_daily to have a different average there
	param graph_ext to have specify png, jpg, gif etc
 fixed: skip any mails newer than last_date (or today)
        sample.pl to show new options
        filter rules are now converted to lowercase
	default params had "templates" instead of "template"
	pod for new() and all it's parameters
 misc:  slightly faster (17.9 vs 18.2 seconds on my system for my archives)		50% of the time is spent splitting the mail archive into lines and then
	separating these into mails, and these in headers and bodies. There is
	surely room for improvement...
2002-08-31 v0.11_1 Tels (not released)
 tests: test target address extraction
	99 tests
 fixed: much improved target address extraction
        bug in _prediction() that used Today() instead of last_data 
 added: valid_forwarders to ease target extraction
        prediction for yearly stat based on last 60 days
2002-09-23 v0.11_2 Tels (not released)
 tests: add_percantage
	99 tests
 added: can add percentage values in parens after value (for rule)
 fixed: removed needless use Exporter;
2002-11-14 v0.11_3 Tels (not released)
 added: create index file for each archive and re-read it if available
        (makes it MUCH faster on subsequent runs)
        use File::Spec whenever possible
2002-11-16 v0.11_4 Tels (not released)
 added: re-read the index files
        prefer gzipped index files
 fixed: use Compress::Zlib for reading gzip files instead of unportable zcat
	actually call the target extraction routine (but still does not work)
2002-11-18 v0.11_5 Tels (not released)
 fixed: use Compress::Zlib for writing gzipped index files
	target extraction works now again (at least a bit 3/6 failed tests)
	don't need to write out 'target_domain' to index, 'domain' suffices
 added: replace ##took## in template by time taken (use Time::Hires)
	percentages for target and domain
2002-11-19 v0.11_6 Tels (not released)
 fixed: some "unitialized warnings"
        writing out skipped items and compressed size to fix these on read
        (items_skipped vs. skipped_mails and archive_size_uncompressed vs.
	 size_uncompressed)
	don't write out "domain" to index, extract it on read from target
	skip mails w/ dates w/ year < 1970 and > 2038 (make Mktime() happy)
 added: keep track of scores (SpamAssassin) and make histogram
        (still needs todo the scatter and daily_score graph, though)
	die() if an unknown option is passed/found
2003-10-24 v0.11_7 Tels (not released)
 added: first_date - exclude any mail with a date earlier than this (as bogus)
	support for the following date formats:
        # Sun, 19 Jul 03 23:49:16 +0200
        # 18 Oct 2003 23:45:29 -0000
2003-11-02 v0.12 Tels 110 tests
 fixed: uses much less memory when reading in a mail-archive (not index)
	(mail was hold in memory twice, while creating a big structure
	 containing the mail headers and id. Now it is processed line by line
	 and the stats are calculated directly)
	calculate size of mails correctly (forgot to take body into account)
	don't write 'toplevel' to index, we can reconstruct it from 'target'
	target address extraction works now
