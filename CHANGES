2002-03-29 v0.01 Tels first version
  - derived from stand-alone script
  - graphs: per day
	    per month of year
	    per month
            per day of month
            per year
            per day of week
	    per top-level domain
  - made package, with MANIFEST et al.
  - added some basic pod
  - added two basic tests
  - read in template, and write out as html
  - refined template and made it using a stylesheet
2002-03-31 v0.02 Tels
  - use Date::Calc for Date_to_Days and some others
  - tests for _parse_date
  - _parse_date(): return 0 for undefined or invalid dates, return numerical
    values, correct year to be 4 digits
  - added graph: daily (w/ rolling average) 
		 rule (filter rules)
		 target (per target address)
  - renamed graphs: per_month => monthly, year => yearly
  - added the ability to supress generation of each graph
  - refined sample template
2002-04-07 v0.03 Tels 01:29 (first released version)
  - refined samples to be really generic
  - fixed bug: the last mail per archive was always dropped
  - graph's have now a minimum width to prevent cut-off texts
2002-04-07 v0.04 Tels 05:30
  - /^From/ detection a bit more strict
  - don't die, but warn and skip files that don't look like mail-archives
  - gather_mail: handle non-gziped mail-archives, too
  - gather_files: take all ordinary files (not just *.gz)
  - better doc
2002-04-07 v0.05 Tels 16:43
  - draw values for yearly, and per domain stats
  - draw light-gray y grid
  - fixed width for bars for domain/yearly stats
  - 15% instead 5% on top if values are shown
  - 25% instead 5% on top if values are shown and vertical
  - count items in last 30 days and instert as last_30_days into template
  - fixed pod =hea1 NAME
  - added 'hour' stats
  - can filter out target domains and/or addresses (these appear as unknown)
2002-04-08 v0.06 Tels 00:05 (damn, nearly four releases in one day ;)
  - prediction for current year/month (thanx Bill Kearney)
  - the prediction code made necc. a different algorithmn for determining the
    maximum value, this also fixed the dailys stats, which were too spacy
2002-04-08 v0.07 Tels (never released)
  - fixed CREDITS file
  - fixed history (speling, times)
  - removed some debug prints
2002-04-27 v0.08 Tels
  - added graph: last x days (w/ rolling average for 7 days) 
  - added stats for compressed/uncompressed archive size
  - tests for _average function (testsuite still highly incomplete)
  - option 'average' (for average over Y days) works now
  - removed useless sorting of keys when doing average
  - fixed sample template, and sample script to show new options
  - 38 tests
2002-05-09 v0.09 Tels (never released)
  - refined rule cleaner
  - fixed: input can be a file, too
  - color brown looked ugly, added some more colors to prevent wrap around
2002-08-03 v0.10 Tels
 tests: added some for default and overwritten options, and for month_to_num
	93 tests
 added: param last_date to make stats that end on a different day than today
        param average_daily to have a different average there
	param graph_ext to have specify png, jpg, gif etc
 fixed: skip any mails newer than last_date (or today)
        sample.pl to show new options
        filter rules are now converted to lowercase
	default params had "templates" instead of "template"
	pod for new() and all it's parameters
 misc:  slightly faster (17.9 vs 18.2 seconds on my system for my archives)		50% of the time is spent splitting the mail archive into lines and then
	separating these into mails, and these in headers and bodies. There is
	surely room for improvement...
